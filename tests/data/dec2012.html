<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time. Remote is fine too.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.<p>We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers
* growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)
* iOS engineer<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a> (The Future of Science)<p>We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine. We will handle re-location, including visas, if you would like to re-locate, but re-location is not necessary.<p>If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4858195 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=4858195&dir=up&by=joshz&auth=8269fb1b7d6c4447ecb65ae4247ea856736d11c5&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%38%35%37%37%31%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4858195></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mrkurt">mrkurt</a> 89 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4858195">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>MongoHQ (SF Bay, remote doable)<p>We do database operations and hosting, and just closed our A-round. We're hiring to solve a lot of different problems, but especially looking for help with:<p><i>Backend engineering</i> - If your ideal work day involves building software to run across hundreds of systems and care about databases, you are someone we want to talk to. We have everything from server level monitoring/control agents to protocol proxies to backend metrics systems that need love.<p><i>Operations/devops</i> - If you have used chef/puppet or similar, get irritated about "snowflakes" (one off servers), and have a sometimes irrational desire to automate everything, you are someone we want to talk to. We are one of the companies where operations is the product, so work on the backend systems will often make its way in front of users.<p><i>[Whatever you do well]</i> - If you have some combination of skills that you think we need, let us know why we should be thinking about them.<p>----------------------------------------------<p>Our tech "stack" is largely node.js/Ruby/Mongo/Redis and we've experimented with Go/Erlang/(other databases). We generally believe in using the right tool for a give job. If you want to  tackle a particular problem with OCaml, for instance, you probably won't face much friction.<p>We have an office right next to the Caltrain in San Mateo (15 mi south of SF) and are willing to let people work remotely if they desire. We will also cover relocation for good people. Our priority is "people who get things done, sometimes in anger" and almost everything else is negotiable.<p>If you're interested, email hello@mongohq.com and ask us some questions (or tell us a story).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mapquest.com<p>Primarily in Denver, CO and Lancaster, PA, but we're a relatively distributed
company so go ahead and ask if you live somewhere else. As an AOL subsidiary,
we've got employees who work out of AOL offices around the world so it wouldn't
be unheard of to work from e.g. Seattle or New York if you decide Denver's just got
too much sunshine. I've also been told we will sponsor an H1B.<p>Over the past year, MapQuest has brought on an almost entirely new management
team to shake things up and change the direction of the company from answering
the ? "How do I get there?" to answering the more interesting ? "Where do I want to
go?" We've released two new products in the last year (Discover and Local, formerly
known as Vibe) and are aggressively working on creating an engineering-driven
culture that actually builds things people might want to use instead of polishing
products that were cool in 2004. We've had a banner year, and are looking to hire
engineers as well as product managers to continue this upward trend.<p>Among the technical roles we're looking to fill are several Ruby developers at
varying levels of expertise to help develop new products as well as one Java
developer to work with our data team and revamp various backend services
(i.e. search, geocoding and a data ingestion service that populates our location
databases). Ever since Valve leaked their company handbook, the phrase "T shaped"
has been been thrown around a lot by upper management, so you'll need to be
able to do full-stack development. We do a lot of pair programming right now, so if
you've got experience doing that, it'd be a big plus. We're particularly interested in
someone who's got very deep Rails experience to serve as a sort of tech lead, but we
have many positions open for Rails people so if you'd be interested at all drop a line.<p>Product is looking to bring on people with some combination of travel industry
knowledge and mobile applications to help get the company past maps and
directions. Most of our product people have development experience, so you'll be
expected to be able to "talk shop" with the engineers you work with, but your day-
to-day responsibilities aren't going to be producing code as much as producing
ideas, pitching them to the rest of the company and helping the engineers and
designers see them through to completion.<p>I can definitively say that MapQuest is among the best places I've ever worked. The
office space is fantastic (Downtown Denver right off the 16th Street Mall) and the
new management team is very serious about doing things right as we try to pivot
the company away from directions and into product development. The brand is
practically a household name, the product team is happy to listen to engineers for
feedback or ideas, and we've got the interesting position right now of being able to
work like a startup except with a large pre-build audience (I've been told that we
had 40M UV's on a brand new product this past Thursday, for example). You can
read the company postings here (<a href="http://company.mapquest.com/careers/" rel="nofollow">http://company.mapquest.com/careers/</a>) but I'd really enjoy being able to answer ?'s directly. My e-mail is in my profile and please
feel free to contact me personally if you have further ?'s, want to chat, or anything
else. Happy holidays, and hope to hear from some of you soon!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4858089 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=4858089&dir=up&by=joshz&auth=d33deda18b9f90cb215d98a7b138510104fa2a61&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%38%35%37%37%31%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4858089></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=josh2600">josh2600</a> 89 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4858089">link</a></span></div><br>

That's what we're building for consumers, businesses and developers in an elegant way with a huge focus on design. Looking for someone excited at the stage we're at - dealing with first customers, ramping up traction, figuring out new product direction and features - and also excited about the challenges we'll face, like making payments simplified for consumers and dealing with huge technical issues with fraud and building payments infrastructure.<p>We went through AngelPad in the fall and raised a big seed round from great investors.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>Sharing over social media is driving an ever-increasing percentage of web traffic, and becoming more central to the adoption and spread of every type of application. But app developers are flying blind -- not only are traditional web analytics very bad at tracking social traffic due to the rise of mobile clients and increasing prevalence of HTTPS, but even when they have the numbers, they don't have actionable data.<p>That's the problem awe.sm solves: our platform tracks sharing behavior and results, and ties them back into meaningful metrics -- whether thats page views, signups, or a dollar value in sales. Our APIs and drop-in integrations allow developers to integrate social data deeply into their products without needing to reinvent the wheel (and our wheel is really shiny).<p>We're an engineering-driven team building products primarily for other developers, so we're passionate about providing an amazing experience for developers. To help us get there, we're looking for a Developer Experience Lead, which you might also call a Platform Evangelist. By that we mean somebody who will own the experience a developer has using our product: somebody who understands deeply how to get the most out of awe.sm, and has the communication skills to get that information to developers. That will mean representing awe.sm at hackathons, conferences and other developer events, and being the primary point of contact for developers building on our platform on Stack Overflow and other forums. We want you to find the pain points before our customers do, and feed that information back to the engineering team, so we can adapt our product to real-world needs.<p>This is an unusual role, combining technical talents with public speaking and writing skills, but for the right person it's a dream job, and there's no role more critical to our growth right now.<p><a href="http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://totally.awe.sm/jobs?source=hackernews</a><p>We're 14 people right now.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco | Fullstack Engineer, Backend Engineer and Frontend Developer | Perfect Audience<p>What We Do: We've built the world's first and easiest Facebook ad retargeting solution, and we have much more ambitious plans. We believe advertising is a critical part of the internet economy, and want to help small business and publishers succeed with solutions that just work.<p>Who We Are: We're a team of four, split between some of us doing the selling and the rest of us doing the building. We want to bring in more designers and developers to help us keep building new features as fast as we can. Ideally these folks will be ready to dive into anything, pitching in when fires come up. But, they will also own some piece of the product where we need expertise.<p>Traction: We are increasing our revenue by 25% every week and it's going to do nothing but accelerate with some big clients we have lined up in the coming months.<p>What we look for in teammates: 
Smart, really smart 
Eager to join a growing startup 
Has a “maker” attitude 
Good at communicating (ready to discuss features, bugs, architecture, etc.) 
Language never trumps experience - but if you know Rails, Mongo and Javascript things will go faster 
Appreciation for puns and movie quotes 
Experience in advertising is a HUGE plus<p>Backend Engineer
About the Position: We're looking for someone to be the primary backend person at Perfect Audience. This person will guide us as we think about restructuring our data storage and help us prepare for more data influx and more demanding data analysis and visualization.
What we are looking for: 
Solid understanding of database paradigms and architecture
Ability to look at a series of customer or team needs and help us pull together the right technology, queries and optimizations 
Ability to cover DBA or Sys Admin needs is awesome<p>Full Stack Engineer
About the Position: We're a team of full-stack engineers who enjoy database design, application logic, and standards-based frontends. We are always looking for more smart generalists to come join us. This is a chance to work on every facet of a successful web app and grow your engineering skillset.
What we are looking for: 
Solid software development foundation 
Ability to architect, develop, and test key infrastructure
Understanding of performance and design tradeoffs, without compromising quality
Experience scaling up webapps and services for rapid growth is a plus<p>Front End Designer / Developer
About the position: We regularly get complimented on our design and interface, but we don't want it to just be better than the enterprise tools - we want it to be delightful. We want a skilled individual to come in and own the design and user experience.
What we are looking for: 
Someone as comfortable editing masks in Photoshop as tweaking CSS in a text editor 
Innate understanding of, and instinct for, design and user experience

  | Redwood City, CA - UI Engineer |
  +--------------------------------+
</code></pre>
Tidemark Systems (<a href="http://www.tidemark.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.tidemark.net</a>, note ".net") is hiring.<p>Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem.  For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of.  But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do.  So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great.  But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS.  You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience.  If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code.  This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job.  This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound.  The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.<p>We've got a bunch of other openings (see <a href="http://tidemark.net/company/careers" rel="nofollow">http://tidemark.net/company/careers</a>)<p><pre><code>    * UI Engineers
    * Director Corporate Communications
    * Product Support Engineer
    * Director of People Operations

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Two Sigma (SoHo, NYC) - Full Time, Intern, H1B<p>Did you know there's a company based in Soho that has enough technology to be considered among the world's Top 250 supercomputing sites? One that imports over 5TB of data every single day, and has alumni from Google, Intel, and Microsoft?<p>You might think I'm talking about some stealth-mode startup, but I'm talking about where I work: Two Sigma Investments. At our core, we're a technology company applying our talents to the domain of finance. We've created a system that combines artificial intelligence and keen human insight — a system that's constantly improving and advancing.<p>We're looking for a diverse set of technologists to join our team. Our challenges require mastery of areas such as kernel level development, machine learning, and distributed systems. Our team includes a Unix Lifetime Achievement winner, Putnam medalists, ACM Programming competition finalists, and International Mathematics Olympiad medalists. We are proud of our individual pedigrees, but even prouder of our teamwork.<p>We tend to hire people with at least a bachelor’s degree in a technical or quantitative field and experience with C or languages that target the JVM, but we are open-minded in our search for critical thinkers who are passionate about technology. We analyze the data-rich domain of finance, but financial experience is not a requirement. We hope to hear from you!<p>Dave Hahn dave.hahn@twosigma.com <a href="http://www.twosigma.com/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.twosigma.com/careers.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4858002 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=4858002&dir=up&by=joshz&auth=332bfb57cd4fe68ab83c3316c471b46dd80f2544&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%38%35%37%37%31%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4858002></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=salar">salar</a> 89 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4858002">link</a></span></div><br>

We started off by interviewing some of our customers to learn about their needs.  Using that information, we held design studios and brainstorming sessions to flesh out what the actual features and user experience would be like.<p>On the front-end, we decided to build a new Javascript-powered rich UI using responsive design techniques. Many people are working on responsive design for content-based sites, but few are doing it for browser-based applications.<p>On the back-end, we designed an Event Driven Architecture that makes use of Event Sourcing. Instead of updating a relational database in-place when things change, we store a series of discrete application events. We can then replay those events to create the state of the world at any point in the past, right up to the present. (Yes, we’ve built a time machine!)<p>Does this sound like the sort of thing you’d like to do? If it is, we’d like to hear from you.<p>In return for your passion and commitment to code quality, you’ll enjoy an awesome work environment with perks like:
Unlimited vacation days!  Yes, unlimited!
Quarterly hackathons
A game room and a well-stocked kitchen
Exciting events including holiday parties, picnics, talent shows, pumpkin carving and more
Company sponsored athletic teams
Competitive salary, bonus and stock options

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Swift Software - Frederick, MD (Near DC) - Software Engineers for Product Development and Professional Services<p>Are you tired of commuting to DC or Northern Virginia? Swift Software is a growing product-centered technology company seeking talented developers to join our development and proserv teams in Frederick, MD. Our flagship product is JobTraQ, a task management and workflow system that offers vastly more flexibility and power than any other product in our market segment, and is significantly less expensive and easier to configure than big "BPM" suites like MetaStorm and Lombardi. These advantages are allowing us to disrupt both markets.<p>Product developers will create new features in JobTraQ and enhance existing functionality. You’ll help us build advanced visual design and administration tools, augment the product’s business intelligence capabilities, improve performance and scalability, and use customer feedback to enhance all parts of the system.<p>Proserv developers will work with our mid-market and enterprise customers and our business analysts to design and implement software solutions that build on JobTraQ's capabilities. Our implementation and customization projects are usually one week to two months long, so you’ll enjoy a wide range of work on interesting problems for clients in many regions and industries. Recent projects have included a touchscreen system for warehouse tracking, integration with accounting systems, complex custom finance and billing reports, and automatic data synchronization.<p>Both teams have an enjoyable and collaborative culture in a creative environment. We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base. Our environment is relaxed and fun, we play everything from Total Annihilation to Alien Swarm at our game nights, and we equip everyone with new quad-core Thinkpads with SSDs and dual monitors. Our policies and benefits are family-friendly, with generous vacation time, good health insurance options, and flexible work schedules.<p>For more information about these positions, see the links below.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yikes Corp  ||  Tokyo, Japan /  San Francisco  /  Geoflexible  ||  CTO<p>Yikes is a social media content creation company. Businesses need daily text content for their Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, and blogs. We create that content at scale, hassle-free. Our customers are some of the largest ad agencies and brands in the world. We’re growing quickly and so far have managed to finance our own growth with our profits, but we’re looking to fundraise soon.<p>There are 2 people on the core team, and we coordinate a team of freelance writers who create all the content which we then sell to our customers. At the moment we’re doing this all by hand, and we need a generalist-type full-stack engineer to give our company some much-needed tech muscle.<p>The thing we need short-term is a web application which allows for content (text + links + images) to be input by our employees and passed through a workflow chain which ends at our customers. The thing we need long-term is a mechanism which allows our customers to be intelligently paired up with employees who would be a good fit for them- and also uses analytics from Facebook + Twitter + anything else to help us learn more about how to provide our customers with awesome, effective, engaging content. This is going to involve a lot of iteration and that’s why we need a new core member of our team instead of an outsourced partner or contractor etc. This is a green-field proposition: you can work with whatever tech tools you like. You’d be the guy or gal in charge and we will stay out of your hair about that kind of stuff.<p>We are two dudes from the US who’ve spent a lot of time in Japan – I live in SF now and my partner is in Tokyo. A lot of our clients are in Japan because that’s where we started, but we’re scaling up in the US now too. You can work from wherever you want, Tokyo included.<p>To make sure this works for everybody, we’d like to do a 3-month trial period starting in January wherein we’d pay you a monthly salary- and then, assuming everyone’s happy, you’d get a substantial grant of stock (co-founder level). This is pre-financing, so you’d be getting in on the ground floor.<p>TL;DR: We’re good at business and sales but we suck at tech, come and work with us, #hacktheplanet.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>TrialPay - San Francisco - F/T<p>TrialPay is looking for someone to own the user-facing portion of our product. Basically, you should think like a PM, have the vision of a world-class designer, and code like a beast.<p>Asking for one person to be able to do all of these things is ambitious, sure, but you’d be working on some pretty amazing stuff.  We put a huge premium on beautiful UIs, clean re-usable front-end code, and amazing user experience. This focus has helped us become a leader in the online advertising space, and with over 100mil+ impressions per day coming from all over the world, we conduct UI A/B tests at massive scale.  Our front end is going to be your science experiment.<p>We also have some pretty amazing projects for you to work on and own.  Specifically, TrialPay is changing the way people shop by bridging the gap between the online and offline worlds.  Here’s an early demo of what we’re doing:<p><a href="https://instore.trialpay.com/landing/?offer_id=3503426114533148569&#38;reward=10+Credits&#38;activation_subid=2345&#38;click_id=1234" rel="nofollow">https://instore.trialpay.com/landing/?offer_id=3503426114533...</a><p>Basically users get instant rewards online for offline actions, and for the first time, brick and mortar businesses can determine the efficacy of their online campaigns (social media, pay-per-click advertising, etc.) at a granularity that’s never been possible before.  You’d be making significant contributions to the user-facing portion of this new product as well as that of our other initiatives in the mobile and social spaces, from initial design to prototyping and implementation.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4857960 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=4857960&dir=up&by=joshz&auth=86cdb75f9d6fd7356d641b912fc4c76cb083ba29&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%38%35%37%37%31%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4857960></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dochtman">dochtman</a> 89 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4857960">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>LocBox, San Francisco. Frontend Engineer, Rails Developer, Data Scientist, Inside Sales Representative. Relocations Welcome, H1B Transfers Welcome.<p>More at <a href="http://www.getlocbox.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.getlocbox.com/careers</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/locbox-series-a/" rel="nofollow">http://www.techcrunch.com/2012/10/31/locbox-series-a/</a>.<p>I’m CEO at LocBox (<a href="http://www.getlocbox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.getlocbox.com</a>) and we are looking to work with great folks that share our mission - empowering local businesses to generate sustainable revenue from their best customers. We want to do it with Data, Algorithms and Design in a space that has traditionally lacked all three but is finally turning the corner (and fast).<p>Most local businesses resort to unsustainable daily deals or boring Email Marketing to acquire and retain customers. We reject that status quo and our hundreds of (paying) customers agree. We’ve also developed a new search/crawl/tech-centric way of acquiring our own customers and disagree with the obsolete feet-on-street Sales model. The company is very small but generating material and predictable revenue; net revenue growth has exploded in the last quarter.<p>Our tech team is 3 at the moment and the company as a whole is 9 fulltime folks; we're looking to at least triple the tech team size in the next 6 months. The tech stack is standard-issue Rails/HTML/CSS/JavaScript and is deployed on AWS. The product and tech team operates on weekly sprints and there's a decent bit of Halo-playing and beer-drinking at the completion of sprint milestones.<p>We also just launched with a $5.1M Series A in the press w/ TechCrunch, AllThingsD, GigaOm and VentureBeat.<p>Ready to talk to us? I'm saumil at getlocbox dot com and at <a href="http://www.getlocbox.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.getlocbox.com/careers</a>.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4857771 onclick="return vote(this)" href="vote?for=4857771&dir=up&by=joshz&auth=7af7732745960ea23c8fb4b3cfbaa0445ca61b10&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%38%35%37%37%31%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4857771></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=akshxy">akshxy</a> 89 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4857771">link</a></span></div><br>
